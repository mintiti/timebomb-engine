# Timebomb Python engine
Game engine for the board game Iello Timebomb.
This is developped as a part of a project started with a friend to play with our friends in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic.

It's designed to be able to work as a standalone game engine too if you need it for other purposes.
You can find the other parts of the project on the following repos:  
    - [Backend](https://github.com/phimth/TB-back)   
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/phimth/TB-Front)
